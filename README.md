# challengeBot
A discord bot that provides weekly coding challenges from /r/dailyprogrammer

Every task in the todo list can be done by an individual, if you don't know the way
discord works just make the function and I or someone else will rewrite it to
fit into the discord bot. If you need to access a certain value provided by discord
you can read the discord.py docs to get it or just ask it.  
--------
####Things to do:  
* Scrape [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/) to get the challengeBot  
* Parse the scraped challenge to a discord message  
* Check that a challenge isn't posted on the server before(maybe a database with SQlite or something)  
* Make a background task that does the above features weekly  

#### Extra:  
* make a system with github so people can upload their solutions
